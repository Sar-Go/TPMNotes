# Hi, I'm Sarthak, and this document is framed to accumulate my understanding into the role of Product Management

## Product Manger: Person who brings products to Life

### Skills of a TPM

- Soft Skills

Empathy: Empathy for the user (understand what he wants, his problems)
Long term vision to make calculated decisions, and guesstimates
Having Technical influence so that you can engage better with the engineering team. Having technical influence means being able to cause change without having the authority. As a TPM, you should be technically sound, so as to understand and translate requirements into technical terms, technical operations, workflows, and processes for the product area.
Team leadership skills
Storyteller: Your roadmap should have a story
Communication skills

- Hard Skills

Translating user needs into product requirements by writing clear product specifications.
Analytical skills and problem solving mindset.
SQL, A/B Testing

### Career Progression of a PM

BA/ Product Analyst _->_ Junior PM/ Business Function Specialist (BFS) _->_ Associate PM _->_ PM

```
Q: Is PM the CEO of the product?
A: Though the PM is solely responsible for the product, he still dependent on leadership for
- taking approvals
- delivering product performance reports
- budgets sanctioning
- value added to the company
and many more...
Thus, he is not the CEO of the product.
```

A TPM is an impactful person as:

- Define the product that will solve a problem and map customer’s persona and journey
- DEvelop the right mindset needed to bring viable products to the market
- Analyse strategies and frameworks for new product
- Evaluate product roadmapping and prototype decisions
- Outline a plan to create a competitive scalable product
- Explore various tools available for marketing in a digital environment
- Financial analysis and growth management of the product

```
Q: A PM is responsible for managing his team. Can you tell some Do’s & Dont's when managing team
- Count on your team’s skills
- Do not micromanage
- Do not walk up to their screen to check their work
- Trust them
- Take ownership
- Remove blockers (Escalate issues that teams are facing)
- Have Technical skills, to understand your engineering team better
```

### What Does a TPM do?

A TPM wears different hats. He helps the team and company to build and ship the right product. He answers the questions like:

- What product should the team build?
- Why is that product relevant?
- What would be the strategy/ roadmap for building that product?
- How will we find a market fit for the solutions we are offering?
- Is this the right time to invest in building a product that solves this problem?
- Is this even the right problem to solve?

> A TPM glues business, engineering, and UX together.

A PM is responsible for answering this questions, formulating a roadmap, and executing it. He is involved in decision making. <br/>

> A skill, that TPM must have is to make accurate guesstimations and give ballpark figures on the go, based on hypothesis. He must be master in making metrics based reports and make data driven decisions on the fly.

### Digital Product Life Cycle

1. IDEATION: Idea Generation Identify the pain point of user, find gaps in the market, and strategically create roadmaps … and deliver.
   Generate ideas by listening to users, brainstorming, analysing what competitors are doing. User Experience is one of the top priorities to consider for a TPM. Example: Consider, you are automating a coffee selection process for a customer. Instead of overwhelming the user with the lot of coffee choices he can have, you can enhance his experience by categorising the coffee based on certain parameters such as level of bitterness, cream content, sugar content, etc.. Also, it would be a nice idea to save the user preferences so that, the next time when he tries to order the coffee, the recommendation can be done based on his past choices.
   Always attach the solution to the problem. If they want Umbrella, and you ship a Shoe, it will definitely fail. Instead, brainstorm on the pain point- that is protecting from rain. Is an umbrella the only solution to protect from rain, or we can launch a product that can provide a better experience to the user.
   A solution may be extremely great but if it does not solve a problem, it is not worth the engineering effort spent.
   A step by step guide to generate ideas is:
   Walk through the main use case
   Evaluate current solutions
   Explain the pain points
   Create new solutions to solve the problem and address the pain points

   > Shiny Object Trap: THe phenomena of someone focussing all their attention on something new and current at the expense of whatever they have been or are currently doing.
   > Example: AI, Blockchain, NFTs, are all shiny product ideas that can set a start-up apart and really successful, BUT, if they are not attached to a purpose, a pain point, or a user group, then they can do harm rather than anything else.

2. Research and Define:
   Who are your users? What do they want?
   Use a persona to identify it. Eg:
   What are the user’s goals and motivation(health, relationship,..): What are they motivated by? Do they want to be healthy, stay motivated, find beautiful relationships?
   Have a clear Description of users, their characteristics, their profession, do they travel a lot? Whatever is relevant?
   What are their pain points in fulfilling their goals?
   What are the use cases you as a TPM can work/solve
   Example: Book Borrowing app:
   Customer want to borrow book online, browse, search and reserve
   Customer wants to input information into system and validate accuracy
   Look for user impacts when confused between multiple use cases
   Who are you solving the problem for?
   Is it the right time to solve this problem?
   Would it be beneficial for us to solve the problem?
   What are the user's goals, aspirations, pain points, and use cases?
   Is there a product market fit for the solution that I am proposing?

3. Build: Develop a Minimal viable product (MVP- minimal possible working version of the product that will get you the maximum learning). A MVP is that version of a new product that allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort
   For a self driving car –> a MVP is = a vehicle that moves around autonomously. It can be a skateboard too!! Upgrade it from skateboard → cycle→ motorcycle → car

4. Test and analyse: Ask BAs, UX engineers and subject users to test the MVP. Gain feedback, and improve the MVP
   A Guide, on how to measure a product’s success

- Why are you building this product?
- Whats your goal → Are you trying to increase user’s retention and make users coming back? Do you want to increase company’s income?
  DEFINE WHAT YOUR PRODUCT IS SOLVING AND CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE
  An acquisition funnel helps in understanding the points that you are missing out on potential users, so you can develop strategies to minimise drop-offs and increase your user base.

5. Rollout: Slowly release the improved version of the MVP
   Staged release- Early Access to some users (Group carefully chosen, power users, or 1% users)
   Limited release
   Public release
   Make sure to have a fallback plan and a management team that is fully on board in case, the product launch fails

> RE-ITERATING WITH IMPROVEMENTS AND PAST LEARNINGS IS HOW THE PRODUCT EVOLVES
